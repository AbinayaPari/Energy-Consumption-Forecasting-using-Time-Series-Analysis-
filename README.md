### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing 

Performed the following tasks in the initial stages:
- Handling Missing Values
- Removing Outliers
- Encoded Categorical Variables
- Data Smoothing

### Exploratory Data Analysis 

Carried out exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying patterns and characteristics of the energy consumption data. This included Correlation Heatmap, Pair plot, as well as identifying and addressing any anomalies or outliers. The insights gained from EDA helped inform the selection and tuning of forecasting models.

### Data Analysis

This study compared the RMSE scores of three modelsâ€”Simple Exponential Smoothing, Holt-Winters Method, and LSTM to predict energy consumption. The model with the lowest RMSE was selected for further analysis and prediction.



### Results and Findings 

The comparative analysis of Simple Exponential Smoothing, Holt-Winters Method, and LSTM models reveals unique strengths and weaknesses in predicting energy consumption. Simple Exponential Smoothing demonstrates low errors, indicating its reliability. The Holt-Winters Method shows higher errors, suggesting limitations in predictive accuracy. The LSTM model, with an RMSE of 109.25 and MSE of 11934.94, exhibits the lowest errors, highlighting its superior capability in capturing intricate patterns and dynamics in energy consumption data.

### Recommendations 

Refine the LSTM model through parameter optimization and explore advanced techniques like ensemble methods or attention mechanisms. Incorporate additional features such as weather data or economic indicators to enhance the dataset. Continuously monitor and improve the model based on user feedback and ongoing evaluation. These steps will contribute to a robust forecasting framework, providing accurate and actionable insights for effective resource management and planning in the energy sector.
